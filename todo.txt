Rough todo
==========

[num] = Priority. Lower numbers = higher priority. Only [1] is guaranteed to be tried to fit into the next version.

x [1] Code some general menu:
    x Poking memory.
    x Execute a JSR.
    x Submenues.
    x Be able to "go back".
    x Remember last position.
    x press B to go back (not from main menu)?
    x choice menu item
    x background gfx
    x use left/right to toggle choice menu items
    - make each header have a (sub) menu
    - make sure to only go to this game mode when its safe to do so
        - not while bringing up the item menu
        - not before selecting a file

- [1] Move controller 2 inputs to the menu.

- [1] Add buncha cool stuff to the menu. Inventory/game state editing etc.

- [1] Teleport "anywhere".

- [1] Show all 3 digits for enemy HP.

- [2] Hack Module_Intro to go to file select as soon as everything needed is initialized.

- [2] Add some footprint w/version (intro, file select, pause menu).

- [2] Make it possible to show the hidden line-of-sight sprites.

- [3] Ingame manual counter (to practice a trick X times and see your success rate).

- [3] Reenable floor indicator and position it underneath counters.

- [3] Lagometer. Toggleable feature that makes the magic go down/up depending on how laggy a frame was.

- [3] Better frame advance mode. Perhaps only pause while holding L in, and if you press R while holding L it advances
      the game one frame. Would be good for clip practice.

- [3] Make counters not run while game is paused (frame advance mode). Can be useful for TAS-ing rooms.

- [8] Record inputs (and play them back from state). The holy grail. Would need to replace the RNG to a deterministic
      one. Probably won't happen.

- [9] Level editor.
