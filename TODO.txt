Rough todo
==========

V8:

x Code some general menu:
    x Number widget (min and max).
        - Should maybe make a general function to handle checking these bounds since it comes up all the time.
        - Support repeating inputs (holding dpad button).
        - Word-sized number widget for rupees.
    - Make sure to only go to this game mode when its safe to do so.
        - Item menu, before selecting file.
    - Initialize cm_ values on menu open.

- Teleport "anywhere" w/presets.

- Show all 3 digits for enemy HP.

- Reset segment timer on file load.

- Only show full hearts icon when you can use sword beams.

V9:

- Hack Module_Intro to go to file select as soon as everything needed is initialized.

- Add some footprint w/version (intro, file select, pause menu).

- Set RNG for rooms (trock pokies, aga etc).

- Ingame manual counter (to practice a trick X times and see your success rate).

- Reenable floor indicator and position it somewhere else.

V10:

- Toggle music.

- LoS sprite viewer.

- Lagometer. Toggleable feature that makes the magic go down/up depending on how laggy a frame was.

- Better frame advance mode. Perhaps only pause while holding L in, and if you press R while holding L it advances
        the game one frame. Would be good for clip practice.

- Slowdown.

- Make it possible to draw hearts the normal way.

- Make counters not run while game is paused (frame advance mode). Can be useful for TAS-ing rooms.

Future:

- Save best room times. Make them persist through save/load state.
  This can then be exportable through a web ui. Could even include WR times in next version. Or perhaps a "patch your
  SRM with WR times" web ui. Holy carp.  

- Mashing and pumping minigame (mps, max frames w/o mash, frames lost total etc).

- Reconfigurable controls (save/load state mostly).
