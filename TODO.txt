---------
x Save state for non-SD2SNES (lttphack_SD2SNES.sfc works like before).

x Presets for Low% and 100%. Go to Features to toggle.

x Remember your preferences in the Features menu upon reset also on non-SD2SNES versions.

x Lanmola cycles are reset on preset load.



For V10
-------
x "Fill everything" controller shortcut

x Fix transition Agahnim->Pyramid

x Show idle frames as frames instead of s'ff.

x Coordinates: Toggle decimal/hex.

x Bug: Ice Palace entrance. Strong EG does not stick.

x Fix issue with practice hack menu and mirror transition.

x Fix issue where text box is not cleared if you load preset during text.

x Mute the music such that crystal cutscenes (and possibly other things) aren't affected by turning off the music.
  Ty Myramong for doing all the legwork.

- "Sanctuary heart" option for presets

- Figure out how to practice PoD Mimics with v10 everdrive.

- Ganon bagpipie noises if you make save state after entering pyramid hole & load it during the Ganon fight (phase 3)

- Always lucky

- Show counter for Ganon

- Mute ambient sound effects on sd2snes load?

- Feature: Disable text? Like rando.

- Relook mothula collision. Happens in pre IPBJ too! conveyor related / overlord?
  The moth thing also happens when you load a preset from mire torches iirc.
  Then pod arrow statue and lanmo torches should too.

- Arbitrary memory watch/poke.
  * At the very least, way to see certain things like Ancilla altitude or Arc variable.
  * Probably: Make a new menu "Counters" where some are hardcoded, but you can add your own.
    - Size (1-4 bytes)
    - Format (decimal, hex, s'ff, m's'ff)
    - Color?
    - Maybe add the ability to reorder the counters? Basically go all out on counters.
  * Probably not: Poke.

- Lua script (make presets reproducable automatically):
  x Persist ancilla altitude
  x Persist wallmaster timer
  x Fix arc variable for arrghus preset
  x Fix issue where Link's sword becomes black sometimes.
  * Hundo/Low
  * PoD Mimics preset (can put it in prev room inside door).
  * Automatically add in my manual fixes
    - Crystal state pokey 1
    - Bombs ice
    - Ice rod trock
    - Hook pyramid
    - Add Ganon preset w/magic
  * Make it automatically recreate the cm_mainmenu.asm entries too.

- Some method of not having to wait for 8 seconds if you die and aren't on SD2SNES.
  Perhaps an option "Automatically reload preset upon death" if I can't figure out how to load it during the death animation.

- Any chance that you could add a crystal switch feature, so that we could toggle blue/red?


Maybe
-----
- Faster travel speed via shortcut

- Ingame manual counter (to practice a trick X times and see your success rate).

- Better frame advance mode. Perhaps only pause while holding L in, and if you press R while holding L it advances
  the game one frame. Would be good for clip learning. Maybe stop timer during this.

- Show invisible sprites (Guard LoS)

- Show sprite info in general? Editable?

- Macro editor? Record/play movie from preset? Proof of concept is done (load http://helge.monsternett.no/lttp/ anypct.sfc/srm into your SD2SNES & get that WR)

--------------------------

^ and v = Normal
< and > = Select what to edit
A = Edit
X = Remove line

☑ & ▢ = enabled/disabled
# = set position (use dpad to find position, A/Start to commit, B/X to cancel, L/R to change colors?)

enum Type {
    dec1,
    dec2,
    dec4,

    char name[6];
    bool enabled;
    Type type;
    uint24 address;

---------------------------

1. make linked list of counter-ouput
   struct {
      uint16 position;
      uint8 palette;
      char tiles[10];
   } buffer[];
2. blit it to screen after vblank hud update
