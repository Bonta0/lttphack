- Faster travel speed via shortcut

- Ingame manual counter (to practice a trick X times and see your success rate).

- Better frame advance mode. Perhaps only pause while holding L in, and if you press R while holding L it advances
  the game one frame. Would be good for clip learning. Maybe stop timer during this.

- Reset lanmla cycles upon enter

- Feature toggle/file 3: Persist inventory.

- Shortcut: Fill HP/magic. Or maybe "Get all stuffs".. HP-1 so YBA works?

- Poverty save states

- Fix better transitions:
  * After beating Agahnim
  * Check PoD turtle room > helma. Same lag on blunt's theory tas.

- Presets:
  * Persist wallmaster timer
  * Figure out why rod charges doesn't have AoE
  * PoD Mimics preset
  * More GTower presets? Swamp? Ask Everdrive users.
  * Fix arc variable for arrghus preset

- Show idle frames as frames instead of s'ff.

- Bug: Ice Palace entrance. Strong EG does not stick.

- Coordinates: Toggle decimal/hex.

- Show invisible sprites (Guard LoS)

- Show sprite info in general? Editable?

- Macro editor? Record/play movie from preset?

- Reset Ancilla sprite data (velocity at $029E at least). See if there's a good reset function somewhere?
