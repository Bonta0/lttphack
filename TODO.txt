- Set RNG for rooms:
    * Escape: ZGR
    * ATower: Circle of Pots
    * ATower/GTower: Agahnim BB
    * PoD: Bad Kiki rng
    * PoD: Helmasaur: [random, fireballs]
    * Swamp: Arrghus: [random, easy, medium, hard]
    * Mire/GTower: Firesnakes
    * Ganon
        - Num Warps
        - Warp location

- Ingame manual counter (to practice a trick X times and see your success rate).

- Lagometer. Toggleable feature that makes the magic go down/up depending on how laggy a frame was.

- Better frame advance mode. Perhaps only pause while holding L in, and if you press R while holding L it advances
  the game one frame. Would be good for clip practice. Maybe stop timer during this.

- Mashing and pumping minigame (mps, max frames w/o mash, frames lost total etc).

- Reconfigurable controls (save/load state mostly).
    - Add back "Reset segment timer" input.

- Game crashes sometimes after killing aga2. Same bug as in v7 I presume.
