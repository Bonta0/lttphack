For V11
=======

Big stuff
---------

- Movies

- Ghost Link

- Counters (spec below)

- Rewrite sd2snes save/load state code

- Mashing & Pumping mini-game

- Fix lag:
	debug hacks:
		A = $10
		B = $00
		C = $18
		D = $08

Other stuff
-----------

- Preset for double reddies

- Show kill counter for Agahnim 2

- Feature: Disable text? Like rando.

- Faster travel speed via shortcut

- Better frame advance mode. Perhaps only pause while holding L in, and if you press R while holding L it advances the game one frame. Would be good for clip learning. Maybe stop timer during this.

- Show sprite hitboxes in general?

- Show intermediate room time in more places (bonk, walk up stairs)

- See if I can make the menu prettier (let users change color?)

- Colorblind options?

- Frame counter for actions, like swinging your sword, throwing boomerang, enemy movement startup times. Startup/active/recovery.

- Room frame counts that show frame-pixel movement tallies. Would basically be to contrast how many nudge/slowdown/movement frames were lost that is pulled away from room overall time count and lag frames.

- Active movement speed counter. Like the above kinda but shows real time how fast you're going. Would help for things like understanding swim speeds or hidden bastard/rail type deals.

- A way to change/preset your antennae value for spoopy inputs presently lengthy. To easily engage in mirerod entanglements.

- hey pinkus! Thanks for working on the LTTP practice hack. I have a feature request. I'm still early enough in my NMG play that i get the powder. It's annoying to have to turn on for every single preset, I imagine in the same way turning on the sanc heart was annoying. Can we get a setting to have powder on for the presets? (medium priority)

Low priority
------------
- Make the menu redraw less often, just for practicality's sake and less disruptive fblank

======== MINIGAMES TODO ========

- Mini games (menu)

    Duration: [2s, 5s, 10s]

    [Start Mashing mini game]

    Direction: [up, left]

    [Start Pumping mini game]

- Mashing:
    * Countdown 3s
    * Count number of frames where $F0/$F2 is set vs not set
    * Results:
        - frames with new input
        - frames with no new input
        - hz
        - average time loss per text box
        - average time loss per nmg run

- Pumping:
    * Countdown 3s
    * Count number of frames where cardinal is held and diagonal is held
    * Track number of dpad changes
    * Results:
        - # of pumps
        - frames where cardinal is held
        - frames where diagonal is held
        - # of pixel boost chances per second on average
            * for air and for wall, according to my hypothesis


======== MOVIES TODO ========

- Movies (menu)

    [ Options ]
        Record: [Disabled, Movies, Ghost Link, Both]
        HUD: [No, Record, Play, Both]

    [ Save current movie ]
        - Should be put at the top, pushing everything down.

    ( List of movies )
        - A to play movie
        - Y to play ghost link
        - X to delete
        - Could use preset names
        - Infinite scroll

- Stop movie before saving movie from menu

- Disable SD2SNES save/load state 

- Disable movie record on Poverty states

- During playback:
    * L = Pause playback when held
    * L + tap R = Frame advance once.
    * L + hold R = Slow motion (after 30f of holding)
    * X = Stop movie (gives control back to player)
    * A = Replay movie from start


======== GHOST LINK SPEC ========

- Record type
    * 1 = movie only
    * 2 = ghost only
    * 3 = both
    Needs to be stored in Movies meta.

- Depending on record type, we populate !ram_movie differently
    * Ghost format:
        ttffffff ffffffff yyyyyyyy yyyyyyyy xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx ddaaaaaa
        - t = 0
        - f = frames
        - y = y coord
        - x = x coord
        - d = direction
        - a = animation data (dashing, picking up pot, holding wall, shooting bow, idk.. probably need more bytes if we want it to actually look good too)

    * Movie format:
        ttffffff ffffffff BYSTudlr AXLR0000
        - t = 1
        - f = frames of inputs held
        - rest = which keys are held

    * RNG format:
        tt000000 nnnnnnnn
        - t = 2
        - n = rng value

- When replaying, we need to either select Movie or Ghost.
    * Look for highest two bits to find out if it's a Ghost entry, Movie entry or RNG entry.
      Jump over stuff we should jump over.
      Track RNG index separately and call `LDA #!ENTRY_RNG : LDX !ram_rng_index : JSR find_next_entry`.


======== COUNTERS SPEC ========

DNGSCR  ☑  hex1  0000A0  #
OWSCR   ☑  hex1  00008A  #
HSCRLL  ▢  hex2  0000E2  #
VSCRLL  ▢  hex2  0000E8  #
ROMDTA  ☑  hex1  000403  #
LAYER   ▢  dec1  0000EE  #
GNOCNT  ☑  dec2  000123  #
ALTITU  ☑  dec2  0002A2  #
PODSCR  ☑  dec2  00F0D4  #

ADD NEW

--------------------------

^ and v = Normal
< and > = Select what to edit
A = Edit
X = Remove line

☑ & ▢ = enabled/disabled
# = set position (use dpad to find position, A/Start to commit, B/X to cancel, L/R to change colors?)

--------------------------

enum Type {
    dec1,
    dec2,
    dec4,
    hex1,
    hex2,
    hex4
}

struct {
    char name[6];
    bool enabled;
    Type type;
    uint24 address;
    uint16 position;
    uint8 palette;
} counters[]

---------------------------

1. make linked list of counter-ouput
   struct {
      uint16 position;
      uint8 palette;
      char tiles[10];
   } buffer[];
2. blit it to screen after vblank hud update
