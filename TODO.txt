For V10
-------
x "Fill everything" controller shortcut

- Fix better transitions:
  x After beating Agahnim
  * Check PoD turtle room > helma. Same lag on blunt's theory tas.

- Lua script:
  x Persist ancilla altitude
  x Persist wallmaster timer
  x Fix arc variable for arrghus preset
  * Hundo/Low
  * PoD Mimics preset (can put it in prev room inside door).
  * Automatically add in my manual fixes
    - Crystal state pokey 2 (1?)
    - Bombs ice
    - Ice rod trock
    - Hook pyramid
    - Add Ganon preset w/magic

x Show idle frames as frames instead of s'ff.

x Coordinates: Toggle decimal/hex.

x Bug: Ice Palace entrance. Strong EG does not stick.

x Fix issue with practice hack menu and mirror transition.

- Fix issue where text box is not cleared if you load preset during text.

- Feature: Disable text? Like rando.

- Relook mothula collision. Happens in pre IPBJ too! conveyor related / overlord?
  The moth thing also happens when you load a preset from mire torches iirc.
  Then pod arrow statue and lanmo torches should too.

- Arbitrary memory watch/poke.
  * At the very least, way to see certain things like Ancilla altitude or Arc variable.

Maybe
-----
- Faster travel speed via shortcut

- Ingame manual counter (to practice a trick X times and see your success rate).

- Better frame advance mode. Perhaps only pause while holding L in, and if you press R while holding L it advances
  the game one frame. Would be good for clip learning. Maybe stop timer during this.

- Show invisible sprites (Guard LoS)

- Show sprite info in general? Editable?

- Macro editor? Record/play movie from preset?
