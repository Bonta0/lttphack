---------
x Save state for non-SD2SNES (lttphack_SD2SNES.sfc works like before).

x Presets for Low% and 100%. Go to Features to toggle.

x Remember your preferences in the Features menu upon reset also on non-SD2SNES versions.

x Lanmola cycles are reset on preset load.



For V10
-------
x "Fill everything" controller shortcut

x Fix transition Agahnim->Pyramid

x Show idle frames as frames instead of s'ff.

x Coordinates: Toggle decimal/hex.

x Bug: Ice Palace entrance. Strong EG does not stick.

x Fix issue with practice hack menu and mirror transition.

x Fix issue where text box is not cleared if you load preset during text.

x Mute the music such that crystal cutscenes (and possibly other things) aren't affected by turning off the music.
  Ty Myramong for doing all the legwork.

x Much smoother preset fadein/out.

x Relook mothula collision. Happens in pre IPBJ too! conveyor related / overlord?
  The moth thing also happens when you load a preset from mire torches iirc.
  Then pod arrow statue and lanmo torches should too.

x Any chance that you could add a crystal switch feature, so that we could toggle blue/red?

x Lua script (make presets reproducable automatically):
  x Persist ancilla altitude
  x Persist wallmaster timer
  x Fix arc variable for arrghus preset
  x Fix issue where Link's sword becomes black sometimes.
  x Hundo/Low
  x PoD Mimics preset (can put it in prev room inside door).
  x Automatically add in my manual fixes
    x Crystal state pokey 1
    x Bombs ice
    x Ice rod trock
    x Hook pyramid
    x Add Ganon preset w/magic
  x Make it automatically recreate the cm_mainmenu.asm entries too.

x Figure out how to practice PoD Mimics with v10 everdrive.

x Rewrite transition detection code into sane code

x "Sanctuary heart" option for presets

x Lanmola & Mothula RNG Control

x Some method of not having to wait for 8 seconds if you die and aren't on SD2SNES.
  Perhaps an option "Automatically reload preset upon death" if I can't figure out how to load it during the death animation.

x Fix a bunch of problems with music and ambient sounds.
  x Overworld presets loads correct music.
  x Don't play torch/flute sound infinitly in some cases.
  x Fix most issues where music will suddenly disappear, both on SD2SNES and normal.

x Fix Crystal Switch toggle

x Ganon bagpipes when muted music

x Be allowed to use prachack menu during transitions

x Bunny state is not saved with poverty states

x SD2SNES save state in uw, transition to ow, load to uw again and music is gone

x ATower Barrier skip has strange problems not present in v9

- (Perhaps as a double safety, see why Aga 2 transitions stops when we music is muted

- Figure out why it crashes on snes classic

Ideas
-----

- Movie replay

- Show counter for Agahnim 2

- Arbitrary memory watch/poke.

- Always lucky

- Feature: Disable text? Like rando.

- Faster travel speed via shortcut

- Ingame manual counter (to practice a trick X times and see your success rate).

- Better frame advance mode. Perhaps only pause while holding L in, and if you press R while holding L it advances
  the game one frame. Would be good for clip learning. Maybe stop timer during this.

- Show invisible sprites (Guard LoS)

- Show sprite info in general? Editable?


======== COUNTERS SPEC ========

DNGSCR  ☑  hex1  0000A0  #
OWSCR   ☑  hex1  00008A  #
HSCRLL  ▢  hex2  0000E2  #
VSCRLL  ▢  hex2  0000E8  #
ROMDTA  ☑  hex1  000403  #
LAYER   ▢  dec1  0000EE  #
GNOCNT  ☑  dec2  000123  #
ALTITU  ☑  dec2  0002A2  #
PODSCR  ☑  dec2  00F0D4  #

ADD NEW

--------------------------

^ and v = Normal
< and > = Select what to edit
A = Edit
X = Remove line

☑ & ▢ = enabled/disabled
# = set position (use dpad to find position, A/Start to commit, B/X to cancel, L/R to change colors?)

--------------------------

enum Type {
    dec1,
    dec2,
    dec4,
    hex1,
    hex2,
    hex4
}

struct {
    char name[6];
    bool enabled;
    Type type;
    uint24 address;
    uint16 position;
    uint8 palette;
} counters[]

---------------------------

1. make linked list of counter-ouput
   struct {
      uint16 position;
      uint8 palette;
      char tiles[10];
   } buffer[];
2. blit it to screen after vblank hud update
