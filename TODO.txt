For V10
-------
- Feature toggle/file 3: Persist inventory.
  And/or shortcut to "Get all stuffs".. (HP-1 so YBA works)
  Press shortcut and get all items/equip, 19/20 hp, 120 magic.

- Fix better transitions:
  * After beating Agahnim
  * Check PoD turtle room > helma. Same lag on blunt's theory tas.

- Presets:
  * Persist wallmaster timer
  * PoD Mimics preset (can put it in prev room inside door).
  * More GTower presets? Swamp? Ask Everdrive users.
  * Fix arc variable for arrghus preset

- Show idle frames as frames instead of s'ff.

- Coordinates: Toggle decimal/hex.

- Bug: Ice Palace entrance. Strong EG does not stick.

- Fix lua script and remake presets:
  * Hundo/Low
  * Persist ancilla altitude
  * Automatically add in my manual fixes

- Fix issue where text box is not cleared if you load preset during text.

- Fix issue with practice hack menu and mirror transition.

- Feature: Disable text? Like rando.

- Relook mothula collision. Happens in pre IPBJ too! conveyor related / overlord?
  The moth thing also happens when you load a preset from mire torches iirc.
  Then pod arrow statue and lanmo torches should too.

- Arbitrary memory watch/poke.

- Toggle for removing text completely, like Rando.

Maybe
-----
- Faster travel speed via shortcut

- Ingame manual counter (to practice a trick X times and see your success rate).

- Better frame advance mode. Perhaps only pause while holding L in, and if you press R while holding L it advances
  the game one frame. Would be good for clip learning. Maybe stop timer during this.

- Show invisible sprites (Guard LoS)

- Show sprite info in general? Editable?

- Macro editor? Record/play movie from preset?
