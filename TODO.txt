V8:
===

- Better presets:
  - Only 1 bomb for IPBJ
  - Sanc heart and other safeties not an option
  - Ice rod grabbed after Mire
  - Hookshot on pyramid
  - One extra bomb in swamp (cus of jadin route differences)

- R+Start doesn't work on map screen.


- Feature toggle (like "show input display") should persist through loading a save state.

- The spotlight animation of some transitions covers the menu.

- Preset: Pre Sexy Statue Room. Sometimes Link is put on the wrong layer here. Related to kiki somehow?

  Same with Hammeryump and Turtle rock - Lazer skip.

- Loading preset from Mothula's room to an overworld preset has weird effects.

- Sprite of pot above Link's head sometimes weird. No idea why it happened one time.

- Game crashes sometimes after killing aga2. Same bug as in v7 I presume.

- Got black shield while loading presets in Thieves' a couple times.

V9:
===

- Hack Module_Intro to go to file select as soon as everything needed is initialized.

- Add some footprint w/version (intro, file select, pause menu).

- Set RNG for rooms (trock pokies, aga etc).

- Ingame manual counter (to practice a trick X times and see your success rate).

- Reenable floor indicator and position it somewhere else.

V10:
====

- Toggle music.

- LoS sprite viewer.

- Lagometer. Toggleable feature that makes the magic go down/up depending on how laggy a frame was.

- Better frame advance mode. Perhaps only pause while holding L in, and if you press R while holding L it advances
  the game one frame. Would be good for clip practice.

- Slowdown.

- Make it possible to draw hearts the normal way.

- Make counters not run while game is paused (frame advance mode). Can be useful for TAS-ing rooms.

Future:

- Save best room times. Make them persist through save/load state.
  This can then be exportable through a web ui. Could even include WR times in next version. Or perhaps a "patch your
  SRM with WR times" web ui. Holy carp.  

- Mashing and pumping minigame (mps, max frames w/o mash, frames lost total etc).

- Reconfigurable controls (save/load state mostly).
