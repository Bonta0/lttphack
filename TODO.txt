For V11
-------

Big stuff
- Movies

- Ghost Link

- Counters (spec below)

- Rewrite sd2snes save/load state

Other stuff
- Toggle beams

- Drop rate control: Always, never, random

- Preset for double reddies

- Show kill counter for Agahnim 2

- Mashing & Pumping mini-game

- Feature: Disable text? Like rando.

- Faster travel speed via shortcut

- Better frame advance mode. Perhaps only pause while holding L in, and if you press R while holding L it advances
  the game one frame. Would be good for clip learning. Maybe stop timer during this.

- Show invisible sprites (Guard LoS)
  - Show sprite hitboxes in general?

- Show intermediate room time in more places (bonk, walk up stairs)

- See if I can make the menu prettier (let users change color?)

- Colorblind options?

- Frame counter for actions, like swinging your sword, throwing boomerang, enemy movement startup times. Startup/active/recovery.

- Room frame counts that show frame-pixel movement tallies. Would basically be to contrast how many nudge/slowdown/movement frames were lost that is pulled away from room overall time count and lag frames.

- Active movement speed counter. Like the above kinda but shows real time how fast you're going. Would help for things like understanding swim speeds or hidden bastard/rail type deals.

- A way to change/preset your antennae value for spoopy inputs presently lengthy. To easily engage in mirerod entanglements.

ADD NEW

--------------------------

^ and v = Normal
< and > = Select what to edit
A = Edit
X = Remove line

☑ & ▢ = enabled/disabled
# = set position (use dpad to find position, A/Start to commit, B/X to cancel, L/R to change colors?)

--------------------------

enum Type {
    dec1,
    dec2,
    dec4,
    hex1,
    hex2,
    hex4
}

struct {
    char name[6];
    bool enabled;
    Type type;
    uint24 address;
    uint16 position;
    uint8 palette;
} counters[]

---------------------------

1. make linked list of counter-ouput
   struct {
      uint16 position;
      uint8 palette;
      char tiles[10];
   } buffer[];
2. blit it to screen after vblank hud update
